# The Basics

These questions are about basic programming constructs that should not give you much problems. Unless you are interviewing for junior positions, itâ€™s also unlikely that you will be asked these questions; usually these are building blocks for more complex questions, such as Algorithm Questions, and they are excellent for practicing basic concepts such as Big-O and space/time complexity.

## Arrays

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Arrays are basically just a collection of stuff that have the same type. Key things to remember with array are:

* Accessing any given element takes _constant_ time - in the other words, it takes the same amount of time to access the 1st element compared to the 100th. 
* Because every element are the same type, the space requirement is just N x S, where N is the number of items in the array and S is the space requirement of one item.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
