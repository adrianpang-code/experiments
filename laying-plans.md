As in wars, the key to success for your interview is preparation. Being prepared, both physically and mentally, allow you to focus on your interview and perform your best. 

## The Moral Law

In The Art of War, Sun Tzu describes The Moral Law as the law that causes people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of any danger. In interviews, this is your main motivation. Why did you apply for this company? Why this position? Why did you choose software development as a profession? I have seen countless candidates who seem like they do not want to be in the interview. Perhaps it is nervousness, perhaps the candidate is genuinely not interested in the position and is only looking to practice his interview skills, but there is nothing more off-putting than an uninterested candidate. Before you progress any further, first ask yourself this question: why are you here? Until you have a good answer to this question, do not proceed.

## Heaven

Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. Just like in wars, you want to have the tactical advantage in the interview, which means you want to pick the environment where you can perform the best. If you are a night owl, try not to schedule interviews in early morning; dress comfortably, get plenty of rest. 

## Earth

> Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

> * Sun Tsu, The Art of War

For candidates, this means doing research on the location of the interview. Find out where the closest parking is, and where to go if that parking is full; Prepare a few routes to get to the location, and how much time to budget; Make sure your mobile phone is charged, in case you need to call a cab or fetch maps in case of emergencies; keep the address not just in your phone, but also as a hard copy in case your phone malfunctions. Getting to your interview on-time is the most important aspect of your interview, but it is also the easiest part of your journey with proper preparations. 

## The Commander

> The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence, courage and strictness.

This is where you 

## Method and Discipline

By method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.
