# The Approach

## The Interview

Most companies have a very similar interview process. Typically, the "interview loop" consists of multiple sessions, each last around an hour; the sessions will be led by one or more interviewers, with different backgrounds in different teams. The first 45 minutes or so will be interviewing questions, with the last 5 - 10 minutes allocated for the candidate to ask questions.

## The Interviewers

That's a tough question but thankfully, our team is on it. Please bear with us while we're investigating.

## Presenting Your Solution

As an interviewer, I am more interested in your thinking process in working through a problem than a brilliant solution with the first try. Working through a problem, as well as presenting your solution, demonstrates communications skills that are crucial to a successful candidate. Even if your solution is not perfect, by showing me your thinking process, I can guide you onto the right path.
